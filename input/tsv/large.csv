Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser.

How would I be able to say something is the best, when, it doesn't work on someone elses computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer.

No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart.
